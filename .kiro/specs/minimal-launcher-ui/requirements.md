# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a minimal Android launcher that focuses on simplicity and functionality. The launcher will be detected by the Android system as a valid launcher application and display essential apps (phone, messages, browser) in a text-based format on the home screen. The design emphasizes minimalism with no icons, visible background, and restricted access to recent apps from the home screen. This initial phase focuses solely on the UI implementation for the home screen landing experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to be recognized as a launcher by Android, so that I can set it as my default home screen replacement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses Android's default app settings THEN the system SHALL display this app as an available launcher option
2. WHEN the user selects this app as the default launcher THEN the system SHALL use it as the home screen replacement
3. WHEN the user presses the home button THEN the system SHALL navigate to this launcher's home screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see essential apps displayed in text format on the home screen, so that I can access them without visual clutter from icons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home screen loads THEN the system SHALL display "Phone", "Messages", and "Browser" as text labels
2. WHEN displaying app names THEN the system SHALL use clean, readable typography without accompanying icons
3. WHEN arranging the text labels THEN the system SHALL position them in a clear, organized layout on the screen

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a minimal themed interface, so that the launcher feels clean and unobtrusive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home screen displays THEN the system SHALL use a minimal color scheme with high contrast for readability
2. WHEN rendering UI elements THEN the system SHALL avoid decorative elements, gradients, or complex styling
3. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use simple, clean fonts that prioritize legibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the device's wallpaper to remain visible through the launcher, so that I can maintain my personal background customization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home screen displays THEN the system SHALL maintain transparency or use the device wallpaper as background
2. WHEN the launcher is active THEN the system SHALL NOT overlay opaque backgrounds that hide the wallpaper
3. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable against various wallpaper types
