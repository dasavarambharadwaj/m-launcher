# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a minimal Android launcher that focuses on simplicity and functionality. The launcher will be detected by the Android system as a valid launcher application and display essential apps (phone, messages, browser) in a text-based format on the home screen. The design emphasizes minimalism with no icons, visible background, and restricted access to recent apps from the home screen. This initial phase focuses solely on the UI implementation for the home screen landing experience.

3. WHEN the user presses the home button THEN the system SHALL navigate to this launcher's home screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see essential apps displayed in text format on the home screen, so that I can access them without visual clutter from icons.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the device's wallpaper to remain visible through the launcher, so that I can maintain my personal background customization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the home screen displays THEN the system SHALL maintain transparency or use the device wallpaper as background
2. WHEN the launcher is active THEN the system SHALL NOT overlay opaque backgrounds that hide the wallpaper
3. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable against various wallpaper types

### Requirement 5

4. WHEN displaying favorites THEN the system SHALL maintain the same minimal text-based layout as the default apps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dedicated settings page to manage my favorite apps, so that I can easily add, remove, and reorder my preferred applications.

5. WHEN the settings page displays THEN the system SHALL maintain the minimal design aesthetic consistent with the launcher

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the settings page through a long press gesture on the home screen, so that I can quickly configure my favorites without navigating through system menus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I long press anywhere on the home screen THEN the system SHALL open the settings page
2. WHEN the long press gesture is detected THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate haptic feedback to confirm the action
3. WHEN opening settings from long press THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly between the home screen and settings page
4. WHEN I finish configuring settings THEN the system SHALL return me to the updated home screen with my new favorites displayed

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a full-screen app search interface by swiping up from the home screen, so that I can quickly find and launch any installed app using fuzzy search.
